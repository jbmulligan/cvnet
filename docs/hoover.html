	<h2 align="center"><font color="#000000">in memory of the unseen engine behind CVNet
	</font></h2>


From Steven Shevell here's an account about how CVNet came to be, how it got its name, how some key policies were established, and how Hoover came to manage and lead CVNet: 
<br>
Hoover Chan’s early contributions to CVNet require context. In the mid-1980s email was beginning to take hold. Some scientists had access to it but many did not. Even those with access might need to visit a computing center in a separate building so email messages could sit unread for days. Also, discovering a colleague's email address could be difficult because user names often were limited to four characters with arbitrarily generated digits so, for example, John Smith might be JS14 (the 14th person with the initials J and S asking for email at a given institution).
<br>

CVNet started as a list of email addresses volunteered by visual scientists with common interests. Its transition from concept to a functional system was propelled at an in-person meeting of the Optical Society of America (OSA) in the mid-1980s. Though OSA neither supported nor even was aware of its participation, OSA governance at the time depended on well attended in-person ‘business meetings’ convened during its annual scientific conference. OSA business meetings were separate for each scientific section. At the time I was the incoming chair of OSA’s Color Technical Group and, following earlier discussions with Professor Peter Kaiser at York University, used several minutes of the business meeting to suggest creating a list of those on email. Attendees were invited to add their name and email address to a sheet of lined paper circulated at the business meeting. Scientists in the allied OSA Vision Technical Group also could get on the list. The C and V of CVNet derive from the two OSA Technical Groups: Color and Vision. Peter took home the sheet of paper and sent everyone on it an email. CVNet was up and running. Mission accomplished, so he and I thought.

<br>
CVNet was motivated by the potential for an email community of visual scientists to interact actively and productively. Peter and I, however, were frightfully naive. In short order, potential problems we all can appreciate today began to surface. Some early posts on CVNet were far off topic. Extended one-to-one conversations got broadcast to the whole list. Commercial enterprises found the list and sent everyone unwanted advertisements. Spammers used the email addresses to send unwelcome messages. The germane, active and well informed exchanges meant to define CVNet were being swamped by messages that ranged from irrelevant to irritating.

<br>
Peter quickly became involved with trying to monitor and regulate CVNet but it soon was overwhelming. I do not recall how Hoover came to volunteer as the monitor of the nascent CVNet mailing list but I am sure he rescued it from becoming a useless annoyance. While I cannot confirm that Hoover attended the Technical Group sign-up meeting, he had a presentation at that OSA conference so it seems likely. Hoover generously started handling the technical, privacy, and administrative issues of an expanding group. Most consequentially of all, he monitored submissions so all posts were relevant, appropriate in length and tone (for example, avoiding ad hominem content) and beneficial for the members of CVNet. His contributions of expertise and time made CVNet what it is today.

<br>
Finally, Hoover was keenly aware that a net monitor essentially is censor. He insisted that his decisions about posts follow clear and equitable principles, and asked Peter and me to work with him on that. The most important principle that emerged was that a post must benefit the recipients of CVNet more than the person posting it. He followed this concept consistently, deftly and with appropriate flexibility and common sense. For several years Hoover would consult with Peter and me about posts that fell in a gray area, not for a vote but to have an informed discussion together so he could make a decision. For decades, we on CVNet have benefited tremendously from his technical skill, commitment and, most of all, assiduous judgment.

Frans Verstraten communicated to us a preprint of a final/nearly-final editorial about Hoover to appear in Perception later this year (2025):
EDITORIAL

<br>
When Perception profits from the Vision of a Vision Scientist

<br>
The conundrum of how we improve our research domain has been pondered on by us all, on more than one occasion. Do we need more Open Access? More conferences? Perhaps, smaller but more specialised conferences? Maybe, we need larger, multidisciplinary research teams, or perhaps small, but highly specialised teams? Could access to coffee rooms for more scientific discussion be a necessary condition (Verstraten, 2025)? Each of these suggestions can be plausibly justified. 

<br>
There was an individual who had a vision that accelerated our field possibly more than anyone else, Hoover Chan. Hoover published only one paper in Perception (Cogan, Silverman & Chan, 1984), and was never a member of our editorial board, and therefore would not typically be considered for an obituary. However, this icon was more than just instrumental for many of our esteemed authors. 

<br>
Hoover was Peter Kaiser’s successor as the curator of the world-wide mailing-list ‘CVNet’ (for Color-Vision Network). The place for announcements of all kinds: vacant positions, conferences, obituaries, techniques, to name just a few. Hoover was very aware that the success of good initiatives like CVNet is dependent on responsibility, dedication and hard work. Creative initiatives are born out of enthusiasm but tend to die due to mundane practises; it can be hard to do the same thing for a long time. Hoover’s determination, diplomacy, and efficiency meant he ensured that the latter would not occur. His commitment to maintain CVNet’s reputation as a great source of information for our domain of science was more than exemplary.
 
<br>
Over the years I had several interactions with Hoover, mostly about the transfer of information. Perhaps I was too lazy to locate or read the posting instructions. Other exchanges expressed my occasional frustration with CVNet. Hoover and I were also friends on social media, where I once posted my annoyance with the discussion surrounding ‘the dress’. Particularly about the excessive number of emails that followed and the, at times, unprofessional tone of some contributions. Hoover recommended I change my subscription to the daily digest version of CVNet, which I did and still do. It made my life better. Hoover always strived to make CVNet beneficial for all. 

<br>
In the beginning of 2025, along with several colleagues we wanted to recognise Hoover’s contributions by nominating him for the Nakayama Medal. As it turned out, an honorary acknowledgement of some sort was previously recommended already many years ago. However, for reasons unknown to us, it never crystallised. Incidentally, or maybe fate, one person we added in this mail discussion happened to be on the board of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS) and this colleague told us that there would be a special announcement soon. Clearly the time finally was right. Victor Hugo once wrote: “Nothing… is as powerful as an idea whose time has come”. And it showed: the need to acknowledge Hoover’s work resulted in the well-deserved 25th Anniversary Lifetime Service Award. 

<br>
The time to acknowledge Hoover’s work was highly anticipated, although sadly it also coincided with the end of his time on earth at the age of 69. Several comments of many colleagues on Hoover’s CVNet expressed the importance of appreciation and recognition. Exceptional work in our field that falls outside of the generally accepted performance indicators should not be overlooked, rather appreciation and respect should be expressed much earlier. Let this be a lesson for all of us. 

<br>
I can only hope that Hoover enjoyed the announcement of the award and knew that he had made a significance difference to our field that was highly appreciated. And what a difference he made! Rest in Peace Hoover, friend of all perception scientists.

From Jacque Duncan comes memories of Hoover at UCSF's Ophthalmology department where he developed and applied clinical electrophysiology methods:
<br>
Thank you for collecting memories about Dr. Hoover Chan. Hoover joined UCSF in 2017 and worked with Professor Tony Moore to establish protocols for pediatric ERG testing in clinic patients. He was a scholarly, thoughtful, and analytical colleague who greatly improved our ability to care for patients with inherited retinal degenerations. We are grateful for his dedication and innumerable contributions to our patients.

From Ken Nakayama comes memories of his last conversation with Hoover and of his time at Smith Kettlewell:
<br>
      I called Hoover a week or so just before he  died. The phone kept ringing and eventually his wife Debra came to the phone and to my  shock she said that Hoover was in hospice. Then right away she said I could speak to him on the phone. After a pause, Hoover said hello very very  slowly and then  I realized  sadly that this would be our last conversation so I shouldn't rush it.  It turned out to be a rather long one as Hoover spoke haltingly.  He said his memory was failing yet he was able to   recount many of the good times we had together over so many years.  I reminded him of  some of his accomplishments, particularly ones that others may not know about.  For example, way back in the 1980s, Hoover set up email for  the Smith Kettlewell Institute in a quirky way with a new "alternative" software system called   The "Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link" (the Well). 
<br>
     I have one tiny story about Hoover that has a certain glow as I remember it.  Unknown to me  then was the fact that Hoover was either a math or physics major at Reed College. [Ed.: math]  Legend was that only  very  brainy kids went to Reed, much more so than the Ivy league or Stanford.  Sometime during the 1980s Jerry Silverman was my research assistant and a friend of Hoover's. All of the sudden Jerry  and Hoover were conferring nearby.  They were at a table with many  pieces of paper  with lists of handwritten  numbers strewn about.  What were they doing? After what seemed  a full day, they  came to me with  satisfaction.  They had figured out in exacting detail how the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm actually worked.  While Hoover was known for his great service to the Vision Sciences Community,  also admirable  to me was his genuine interest in really understanding things.
<br>
<br>
From Christopher W. Tyler comes memories of Hoover at Smith Kettlewell and later:
<br>
Hoover had a productive postdoc with me in the early nineties, focused on the first psychophysical studies of the anisotropies of the On-Off pathways of the retino-cortical system. Around that time, he was also a key collaborator on related studies with Alex Cogan at Smith Kettlewell. 
<br>
Hoover was a great community organizer, and  I particularly remember him for organizing the 'Friends of Gerald' group of scientists to walk the 12K Bay to Breakers Run across San Francisco for several years with Gerald Westheimer, who was the oldest participant in the race.  Hoover ...[distributed]  t-shirts printed with the 'Friends of Gerald' moniker, while that for the designee had simply 'Gerald', with his race number being his age (94 in the one I participated in). Gerald is currently the oldest living  neuroscientist, by the way, at age 101 [Ed.: as of late May 2025]. Hoover later told me it took 3 months for his knees to recover from this walk, and mine were similarly affected, though Gerald seemed unfazed by it.
