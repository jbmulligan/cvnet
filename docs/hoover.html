<p>
Our community is deeply saddened with the
passing of Hoover R. Chan in the early
morning of April 30, 2025, at the age of 69.
For three decades Hoover was of course
known to us for providing a cornerstone of
the vision research community through his
stewardship of the Color and Vision
Network (CVNet). This vital communication
platform, which he personally funded and
maintained since the mid 1990s, has been a
primary channel through which vision scientists
worldwide have shared research resources,
scientific advancements, scholarly discussions,
conference announcements, and job opportunities. Beyond this extraordinary service that united researchers across continents, Dr. Chan made significant contributions to vision science through his research and collaborations.
</p>
<p>
Beginning with a B.A. in Mathematics from Reed College,
he earned his Ph.D. at U.C. Berkeley, followed by post-doctoral
fellowships in color vision at Brooklyn College of the City
University of New York with Israel Abramov and in spatial
vision at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute with
Christopher Tyler. He then turned his skills to becoming an
IT specialist for a group of schools in the San Francisco area,
and hosting their local area network. More recently, he held
the position of Full Professional Researcher in the Department of
Ophthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco
Medical Center, where he pursued research in a wide range
of non-invasive electrophysiological studies of human vision
and their clinical applications. On retiring, he rejoined
Smith-Kettlewell in an advisory capacity.
</p>
<p>
Hoover is the current recipient of the 25th Anniversary Lifetime
Service Award from the Vision Sciences Society in recognition
of his four decades dedicated service in maintaining CVnet,
which he funded from his own resources over this entire period.
The many messages of appreciation that have come in following
the brief announcement of his death attest to how much this
channel of communication means to the members of the vision community.
</p>
<p>
A longstanding member of ARVO, OSA, and ISCEV, Hoover also
participated in a wide variety of educational and public
service organizations. He generously contributed his extensive
technical skills, advice, and enthusiasm to the CIE Technical
Committees on standards in vision science. Further, he founded
and/or taught English as a Second Language (ESL) and Citizenship
classes at the Chinese Progressive Association groups in New
York City and San Francisco, and organized and coordinated
health fairs in the San Francisco Chinatown /North Beach areas.
</p>
<p>
Hoover was an experienced yachtsman, caring for a succession
of five different craft based in San Francisco Bay, on which
he would entertain his friends and associates. He also taught
boating safety classes for the US Power Squadron. His many
friends and colleagues will always remember him for his unbounded
curiosity, keen intellect, generosity, social awareness, and
the calm, quiet strength that he maintained in his final days.
He is survived by his wife, Debra Liu and his mother, Asako Chan.
Donations should specify which of the institutions he fostered
should be the recipient.
</p>
<p>
If you have memories, anecdotes, vignettes about Hoover to share,
David Grosof is collecting them to compile and post for our community here.
Please email them, with "cvnet" in the subject line,
to grosof+cvnet@gmail.com. His life will be celebrated in a
remembrance at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute on June 18th.

Frans Verstraten communicated to us a preprint of a final/nearly-final
editorial about Hoover to appear in Perception later this year (2025):

EDITORIAL

<br>
When Perception profits from the Vision of a Vision Scientist

<br>
The conundrum of how we improve our research domain has been pondered on by us all, on more than one occasion. Do we need more Open Access? More conferences? Perhaps, smaller but more specialised conferences? Maybe, we need larger, multidisciplinary research teams, or perhaps small, but highly specialised teams? Could access to coffee rooms for more scientific discussion be a necessary condition (Verstraten, 2025)? Each of these suggestions can be plausibly justified. 

<br>
There was an individual who had a vision that accelerated our field possibly more than anyone else, Hoover Chan. Hoover published only one paper in Perception (Cogan, Silverman & Chan, 1984), and was never a member of our editorial board, and therefore would not typically be considered for an obituary. However, this icon was more than just instrumental for many of our esteemed authors. 

<br>
Hoover was Peter Kaiser’s successor as the curator of the world-wide mailing-list ‘CVNet’ (for Color-Vision Network). The place for announcements of all kinds: vacant positions, conferences, obituaries, techniques, to name just a few. Hoover was very aware that the success of good initiatives like CVNet is dependent on responsibility, dedication and hard work. Creative initiatives are born out of enthusiasm but tend to die due to mundane practises; it can be hard to do the same thing for a long time. Hoover’s determination, diplomacy, and efficiency meant he ensured that the latter would not occur. His commitment to maintain CVNet’s reputation as a great source of information for our domain of science was more than exemplary.
 
<br>
Over the years I had several interactions with Hoover, mostly about the transfer of information. Perhaps I was too lazy to locate or read the posting instructions. Other exchanges expressed my occasional frustration with CVNet. Hoover and I were also friends on social media, where I once posted my annoyance with the discussion surrounding ‘the dress’. Particularly about the excessive number of emails that followed and the, at times, unprofessional tone of some contributions. Hoover recommended I change my subscription to the daily digest version of CVNet, which I did and still do. It made my life better. Hoover always strived to make CVNet beneficial for all. 

<br>
In the beginning of 2025, along with several colleagues we wanted to recognise Hoover’s contributions by nominating him for the Nakayama Medal. As it turned out, an honorary acknowledgement of some sort was previously recommended already many years ago. However, for reasons unknown to us, it never crystallised. Incidentally, or maybe fate, one person we added in this mail discussion happened to be on the board of the Vision Sciences Society (VSS) and this colleague told us that there would be a special announcement soon. Clearly the time finally was right. Victor Hugo once wrote: “Nothing… is as powerful as an idea whose time has come”. And it showed: the need to acknowledge Hoover’s work resulted in the well-deserved 25th Anniversary Lifetime Service Award. 

<br>
The time to acknowledge Hoover’s work was highly anticipated, although sadly it also coincided with the end of his time on earth at the age of 69. Several comments of many colleagues on Hoover’s CVNet expressed the importance of appreciation and recognition. Exceptional work in our field that falls outside of the generally accepted performance indicators should not be overlooked, rather appreciation and respect should be expressed much earlier. Let this be a lesson for all of us. 

<br>
I can only hope that Hoover enjoyed the announcement of the award and knew that he had made a significance difference to our field that was highly appreciated. And what a difference he made! Rest in Peace Hoover, friend of all perception scientists.

From Jacque Duncan comes memories of Hoover at UCSF's Ophthalmology department where he developed and applied clinical electrophysiology methods:
<br>
Thank you for collecting memories about Dr. Hoover Chan. Hoover joined UCSF in 2017 and worked with Professor Tony Moore to establish protocols for pediatric ERG testing in clinic patients. He was a scholarly, thoughtful, and analytical colleague who greatly improved our ability to care for patients with inherited retinal degenerations. We are grateful for his dedication and innumerable contributions to our patients.

From Ken Nakayama comes memories of his last conversation with Hoover and of his time at Smith Kettlewell:
<br>
      I called Hoover a week or so just before he  died. The phone kept ringing and eventually his wife Debra came to the phone and to my  shock she said that Hoover was in hospice. Then right away she said I could speak to him on the phone. After a pause, Hoover said hello very very  slowly and then  I realized  sadly that this would be our last conversation so I shouldn't rush it.  It turned out to be a rather long one as Hoover spoke haltingly.  He said his memory was failing yet he was able to   recount many of the good times we had together over so many years.  I reminded him of  some of his accomplishments, particularly ones that others may not know about.  For example, way back in the 1980s, Hoover set up email for  the Smith Kettlewell Institute in a quirky way with a new "alternative" software system called   The "Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link" (the Well). 
<br>
     I have one tiny story about Hoover that has a certain glow as I remember it.  Unknown to me  then was the fact that Hoover was either a math or physics major at Reed College. [Ed.: math]  Legend was that only  very  brainy kids went to Reed, much more so than the Ivy league or Stanford.  Sometime during the 1980s Jerry Silverman was my research assistant and a friend of Hoover's. All of the sudden Jerry  and Hoover were conferring nearby.  They were at a table with many  pieces of paper  with lists of handwritten  numbers strewn about.  What were they doing? After what seemed  a full day, they  came to me with  satisfaction.  They had figured out in exacting detail how the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm actually worked.  While Hoover was known for his great service to the Vision Sciences Community,  also admirable  to me was his genuine interest in really understanding things.
<br>
<br>
From Christopher W. Tyler comes memories of Hoover at Smith Kettlewell and later:
<br>
Hoover had a productive postdoc with me in the early nineties, focused on the first psychophysical studies of the anisotropies of the On-Off pathways of the retino-cortical system. Around that time, he was also a key collaborator on related studies with Alex Cogan at Smith Kettlewell. 
<br>
Hoover was a great community organizer, and  I particularly remember him for organizing the 'Friends of Gerald' group of scientists to walk the 12K Bay to Breakers Run across San Francisco for several years with Gerald Westheimer, who was the oldest participant in the race.  Hoover ...[distributed]  t-shirts printed with the 'Friends of Gerald' moniker, while that for the designee had simply 'Gerald', with his race number being his age (94 in the one I participated in). Gerald is currently the oldest living  neuroscientist, by the way, at age 101 [Ed.: as of late May 2025]. Hoover later told me it took 3 months for his knees to recover from this walk, and mine were similarly affected, though Gerald seemed unfazed by it.
