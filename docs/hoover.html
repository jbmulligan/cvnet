<p>
Our community is deeply saddened with the passing of Hoover Rory Chan in the early morning of April 30, 2025, at the age of 69. For over four decades, Hoover was of course known to us for providing a cornerstone of the vision research community through his stewardship of the Color and Vision Network (CVNet). This vital communication platform, which he personally funded and maintained since the mid 1990s, has been a primary channel through which vision scientists worldwide have shared research resources, scientific advancements, scholarly discussions, conference announcements, and job opportunities. Beyond this extraordinary service that united researchers across continents, Dr. Chan made significant contributions to vision science through his research and collaborations.
</p>
<p>
Beginning with a B.A. in Mathematics from Reed College,
he earned his Ph.D. at U.C. Berkeley, followed by post-doctoral
fellowships in color vision at Brooklyn College of the City
University of New York with Israel Abramov and in spatial
vision at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute with
Christopher Tyler. He then turned his skills to becoming an
IT specialist for a group of schools in the San Francisco area,
and hosting their local area network. More recently, he held
the position of Full Professional Researcher in the Department of
Ophthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco
Medical Center, where he pursued research in a wide range
of non-invasive electrophysiological studies of human vision
and their clinical applications. On retiring, he rejoined
Smith-Kettlewell in an advisory capacity.
</p>
<p>
Hoover is the current recipient of the 25th Anniversary Lifetime
Service Award from the Vision Sciences Society in recognition
of his four decades dedicated service in maintaining CVnet,
which he funded from his own resources over this entire period.
The many messages of appreciation that have come in following
the brief announcement of his death attest to how much this
channel of communication means to the members of the vision community.
</p>
<p>
A longstanding member of ARVO, OSA, and ISCEV, Hoover also
participated in a wide variety of educational and public
service organizations. He generously contributed his extensive
technical skills, advice, and enthusiasm to the CIE Technical
Committees on standards in vision science. Further, he founded
and/or taught English as a Second Language (ESL) and Citizenship
classes at the Chinese Progressive Association groups in New
York City and San Francisco, and organized and coordinated
health fairs in the San Francisco Chinatown /North Beach areas.
</p>
<p>
Hoover was an experienced yachtsman, caring for a succession
of five different craft based in San Francisco Bay, on which
he would entertain his friends and associates. He also taught
boating safety classes for the US Power Squadron. His many
friends and colleagues will always remember him for his unbounded
curiosity, keen intellect, generosity, social awareness, and
the calm, quiet strength that he maintained in his final days.
He is survived by his wife, Debra Liu and his mother, Asako Chan.
Donations should specify which of the institutions he fostered
should be the recipient.

If you have memories, anecdotes, vignettes about Hoover to share,
David Grosof is collecting them to compile and post for our community here.
Please email them, with "cvnet" in the subject line,
to grosof+cvnet@gmail.com. His life will be celebrated in a
remembrance at the Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute on June 18th.

<br>
For Hoover,
<br>
Scientist and dedicated Mensch
<br>
With many thanks for numerous exchanges over the years
I wish this last posting had reached him in time (Copyright Peter

Rest in Peace

From Jacque Duncan comes memories of Hoover at UCSF's Ophthalmology department where he developed and applied clinical electrophysiology methods:
<br>
Thank you for collecting memories about Dr. Hoover Chan. Hoover joined UCSF in 2017 and worked with Professor Tony Moore to establish protocols for pediatric ERG testing in clinic patients. He was a scholarly, thoughtful, and analytical colleague who greatly improved our ability to care for patients with inherited retinal degenerations. We are grateful for his dedication and innumerable contributions to our patients.

From Ken Nakayama comes memories of his last conversation with Hoover and of his time at Smith Kettlewell:
<br>
      I called Hoover a week or so just before he  died. The phone kept ringing and eventually his wife Debra came to the phone and to my  shock she said that Hoover was in hospice. Then right away she said I could speak to him on the phone. After a pause, Hoover said hello very very  slowly and then  I realized  sadly that this would be our last conversation so I shouldn't rush it.  It turned out to be a rather long one as Hoover spoke haltingly.  He said his memory was failing yet he was able to   recount many of the good times we had together over so many years.  I reminded him of  some of his accomplishments, particularly ones that others may not know about.  For example, way back in the 1980s, Hoover set up email for  the Smith Kettlewell Institute in a quirky way with a new "alternative" software system called   The "Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link" (the Well). 
<br>
     I have one tiny story about Hoover that has a certain glow as I remember it.  Unknown to me  then was the fact that Hoover was either a math or physics major at Reed College. [Ed.: math]  Legend was that only  very  brainy kids went to Reed, much more so than the Ivy league or Stanford.  Sometime during the 1980s Jerry Silverman was my research assistant and a friend of Hoover's. All of the sudden Jerry  and Hoover were conferring nearby.  They were at a table with many  pieces of paper  with lists of handwritten  numbers strewn about.  What were they doing? After what seemed  a full day, they  came to me with  satisfaction.  They had figured out in exacting detail how the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm actually worked.  While Hoover was known for his great service to the Vision Sciences Community,  also admirable  to me was his genuine interest in really understanding things.
<br>
<br>
From Christopher W. Tyler comes memories of Hoover at Smith Kettlewell and later:
<br>
Hoover had a productive postdoc with me in the early nineties, focused on the first psychophysical studies of the anisotropies of the On-Off pathways of the retino-cortical system. Around that time, he was also a key collaborator on related studies with Alex Cogan at Smith Kettlewell. 
<br>
Hoover was a great community organizer, and  I particularly remember him for organizing the 'Friends of Gerald' group of scientists to walk the 12K Bay to Breakers Run across San Francisco for several years with Gerald Westheimer, who was the oldest participant in the race.  Hoover ...[distributed]  t-shirts printed with the 'Friends of Gerald' moniker, while that for the designee had simply 'Gerald', with his race number being his age (94 in the one I participated in). Gerald is currently the oldest living  neuroscientist, by the way, at age 101 [Ed.: as of late May 2025]. Hoover later told me it took 3 months for his knees to recover from this walk, and mine were similarly affected, though Gerald seemed unfazed by it.
