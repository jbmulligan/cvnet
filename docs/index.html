<p>
From <a href="https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/Steven-Shevell">Steve Shevell</a> 
here's an account about how CVNet came to be, how it got its name,
how some key policies were established, and how
<a href="hoover.html">Hoover Chan</a>
came to manage and lead CVNet: 
</p>
<p>
In the mid-1980s email was beginning to take hold.
Some scientists had access to it but many did not.
Even those with access might need to visit a computing
center in a separate building so email messages could sit
unread for days. Also, discovering a colleague's email address
could be difficult because user names often were limited to four
characters with arbitrarily generated digits so, for example,
John Smith might be JS14 (the 14th person with the initials J
and S asking for email at a given institution).
</p>
<p>
CVNet started as a list of email addresses volunteered by
visual scientists with common interests. Its transition from concept
to a functional system was propelled at an in-person meeting
of the Optical Society of America (OSA) in the mid-1980s.
Though OSA neither supported nor even was aware of its
participation, OSA governance at the time depended on well attended
in-person ‘business meetings’ convened during its annual scientific
conference. OSA business meetings were separate for each
scientific section. At the time I was the incoming chair
of OSA’s Color Technical Group and, following earlier
discussions with Professor Peter Kaiser at York University,
used several minutes of the business meeting to suggest
creating a list of those on email. Attendees were invited
to add their name and email address to a sheet of lined
paper circulated at the business meeting. Scientists in the allied
OSA Vision Technical Group also could get on the list. The
C and V of CVNet derive from the two OSA Technical Groups: Color
and Vision. Peter took home the sheet of paper and sent everyone on
it an email. CVNet was up and running. Mission accomplished, so
he and I thought.

</p>
<p>
CVNet was motivated by the potential for an email community
of visual scientists to interact actively and productively. Peter and
I, however, were frightfully naive. In short order, potential
problems we all can appreciate today began to surface. Some
early posts on CVNet were far off topic. Extended one-to-one conversations
got broadcast to the whole list. Commercial enterprises found the
list and sent everyone unwanted advertisements. Spammers used the email
addresses to send unwelcome messages. The germane, active and well
informed exchanges meant to define CVNet were being swamped by
messages that ranged from irrelevant to irritating.
</p>
<p>
Peter quickly became involved with trying to monitor and regulate
CVNet but it soon was overwhelming. I do not recall how Hoover
came to volunteer as the monitor of the nascent CVNet mailing list
but I am sure he rescued it from becoming a useless annoyance. While I cannot
confirm that Hoover attended the Technical Group sign-up meeting, he had
a presentation at that OSA conference so it seems likely. Hoover
generously started handling the technical, privacy, and
administrative issues of an expanding group. Most consequentially of
all, he monitored submissions so all posts were relevant, appropriate
in length and tone (for example, avoiding ad hominem content) and
beneficial for the members of CVNet. His contributions of expertise
and time made CVNet what it is today.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Hoover was keenly aware that a net monitor essentially
is censor. He insisted that his decisions about posts follow
clear and equitable principles, and asked Peter and me to work
with him on that. The most important principle that emerged was
that a post must benefit the recipients of CVNet more than the
person posting it. He followed this concept consistently, deftly and with
appropriate flexibility and common sense. For several years
Hoover would consult with Peter and me about posts that fell
in a gray area, not for a vote but to have an informed
discussion together so he could make a decision. For decades, we
on CVNet have benefited tremendously from his technical skill,
commitment and, most of all, assiduous judgment.
